Functionality
	****Put Slider INPUT on similar function as other INPUT
	***Cap ridiculous calls/ infinity loops* (See if progress is made)
	***Check for if first princPaid < 0.01 (goes negative, breaks)
	***if(princPaid>payment) -> invalidate
	*Tutorial
	*Some problem when min payment is low compared to total (may be infinite loop?)
Visual
	***Fill out tooltip/about information
	**check diff versions of FF/IE/Chrome/Safari**
	*Work on month readout
	*Show only months in graph if < year
	*Header information

UX
	**Deleting a field and then immediately sliding the slider, the event to update (and
		subsequently invalidate) the field never fires
	*Change focus on tab/enter
	*Tab goes to 'add tab' after interest of previous loan
	*Remove snowfall/avalanche buttons from focus list
	*Upon new loan, put focus on loan name

Refactoring
	*Change snowfall->snowball in code
